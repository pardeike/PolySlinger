# PolySlinger
*Build a life-size tower with giant tetriminos in VR*

### About

This is the official repository for Polyslinger, a VR game about stacking 3D pieces like tetriminos inside a game area. The pieces are very large and are handled by tractor beams attached to each hand.

### Motivation

Me, Brrainz, invented Harmony 5 years ago to make my first [RimWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RimWorld) mod and since then Harmony is used in countless Unity mods either by a community adding it or by the game developers adding it officially (like in [Oxygen Not Included](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/130712-oni-is-upgrading-to-harmony-20/)). I have a large community of my own and it is time to start the next endeavor: my own game. Being me, this only can be a fully public and with full, first class mod support. 

Originally, the plan was to release Polyslinger commercially on Steam but I think putting it up there for free and adding support for custom mods is the *right thing to do*. Hopefully this will attract other programmers and designers that want to skip the initial learning curve and are not in the position to put a game on steam (costs money etc).

### Concept

Polyslinger is:
- forever free
- public source code
- community driven (guided by the creator to keep it going)
- built by the inventor of [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)
- first class support for modding
- first class support for custom content loading

### Design

The project as it is now is a working but basic VR game. It is a one man project from the start but instead of focusing on struggling with content and introducing attractive extra features, easy modding will hopefully help to make this scale.

### Basics

Points are awared by completing and collapsing a full layer of pieces and by handling pieces fast and with the least amount of contact points. There are different levels of increasing time constraints and several settings as well a few environments to choose from.

### Roadmap

- make all methods, fields and elements public
- restructure methods for clarity and easier modding
- generalizing the hard coded parts
- adding a mod loading mechanism
- adding a modding UX
- adding a way to load assets from mods
- designing a hello world mod project for getting started fast
- documenting the games basic structure

Lot's to do!
