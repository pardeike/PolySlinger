# IDEAS
- tweet/post your final score screen
- game modes:
  - normal
  - sandbox / casual (no time penalty)
  - build highest tower with loose pieces
- difficulty - easy, medium, hard
- maybe: choose beam mode between "p:near/far=o:near/far+radius" to "p:vertical-angle=o:near/far+stronger-up/down"
- change skybox image with level (4/8 just like sound loops?)
- in higher levels, add more obstacles:
  - pieces have one side black that must be placed on an outside wall
  - 1-2 bombs appear above the last/the two last placed pieces
